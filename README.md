speedtest-complaint-js is a Node.js script that automatically checks your internet speed and posts a complaint on X (formerly Twitter) to your ISP if it's below an acceptable threshold.


**Tired of slow internet and unresponsive ISPs?** speedtest-complaint-js is here to help you hold your internet provider accountable!


### How it Works

1.  **Speed Test:** speedtest-complaint-js uses the `speedtest-net` library to measure your current download and upload speeds.

2.  **Threshold Check:** It compares your download speed to a configurable threshold (default: 80% of your promised speed).

3.  **Complaint on X:** If the speed is below the threshold, it automatically opens a pre-filled post in your browser, tagging your ISP's X handles and including the speed test results.
  

### Features

-  **Automated Speed Checks:** Schedule regular speed tests using cron expressions directly within the script. No need for external crontab configuration!

-  **Customizable Threshold:** Set the minimum acceptable speed ratio to match your plan.

-  **Pre-filled Complaint Post:** Saves you time and effort by generating an X post with all the relevant information.

-  **Cross-Platform:** Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
